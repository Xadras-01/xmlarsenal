XMLArsenal is a PHP-application designed and developed for the various emulators of the well-know MMORPG "World of Warcraft". It displays all kinds of information about a server's population: players, guilds and arenateams. It provides ranking-lists for arena-battles, talent- and arena-calculators and much more.

XMLArsenal was developed for [rising-gods.de](http://www.rising-gods.de/) (1 PvP-Realm, 1 PvE-Realm with more than 4k players simultaniously online in the afternoon hours) and published under the [GPL v3](http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) for the sake of the MMORPG emulator community.


I'm well aware of the fact that there are already some Arsenals out there but the features of XMLArsenal make it unique.


## Features ##

  * 100% XML-Output (XML+XSLT)
  * Multilanguage-Support (currently enGB, enUS, deDE, esES, esMX, frFR)
  * Multi-Emu-Support
  * Multi-Realm-Support
  * Multi-Database-Support (currently FrontBase, InterBase, MySQL, MS-SQL, Oracle 7/8/9/10, PostgreSQL, QuerySim, SQLite)


## Why XML? ##

  * XML provides the best data-interchangability one can get
  * XML can easily be parsed and used by automated processes (users can develop own applications based on your arsenal's data)
  * great separation between content (XML) and layout (XSLT)
  * in case of display errors XML can easily be read by humans
  * XML is a major step towards the [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)
