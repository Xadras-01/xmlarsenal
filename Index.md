Welcome to the Project-Wiki/Homepage of XMLArsenal.

Though I'm German I will write the Wiki in English for in this way a lot people more may benefit from the information. Every one contributing here please do the same.

Please do **NOT** use this wiki for bug reporting, spam, feature requests etc. Use the appropriate tools from the project page instead. For problems while using XMLArsenal please use the mailing list (see right panel), there you can get help from me and other users.


# Preliminary Warning #

Please note that XMLArsenal is beta software. So **it's neither feature-complete nor bug-free**. It should not damage your system or data in any way but there is no guarantee on that, so please **back up your data** before using the software.
Since everything you see has a beta status the core may change during times, even that much that it is necessary to re-program data grabbers or tools that use outputted xml.


# Live Version #

XMLArsenal is developed for [rising-gods.de](http://rising-gods.de), one of the best german free-shared servers for World of Warcraft. We currently have 4k+ players online in the afternoon hours on 2 realms (PvP and PvE). Database language support is for german and english client, server-population though is >90% german.

A Live Version of XMLArsenal can be seen at [http://arsenal.rising-gods.de/](http://arsenal.rising-gods.de/).
