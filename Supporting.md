  * I'm always in need of fresh **DBC-Files**. So if you got them (especially ruRU and koKR would be interesting) - send them :)
  * If you want to help developing XMLArsenal further just write me an email.
  * To make XMLArsenal well known it is helpful to have **DataGrabbers** for all major emulators. If you think you can develop one please let me know. You'll be helped in case of problems!
  * Of course donations are alyways welcome ;)
