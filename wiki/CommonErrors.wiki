=== Empty page or "no element found" XML warning ===

Some PHP installations seem to have problems with set set_error_handler(). If you get a blank page please go to _includes/functions.inc.php_, line 77 and comment it out.

 
=== Error messages starting with "Notice:" or "PHP Deprecated:" ===

Please go to _includes/config.inc.php_, line 21 and set {{{ERROR_REPORING}}} to {{{E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE}}}
 

=== MDB2 Error: already exists ===

seems your php install has PEAR MDB2 already onboard. go to _includes/functions.inc.php_, line 73 and comment it like that:

{{{//set_include_path('./includes/pear');}}}

or simply remove the line. 


=== Error loading stylesheets ===

You must NOT put XMLArsenal into a subdir like /armory. Instead you have to create a domain/subdomain + virtual host for it like "arsenal.yourdomain.com" or "yourdomain.com".
