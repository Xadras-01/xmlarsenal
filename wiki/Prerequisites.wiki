 * Webserver (i.e. Apache 2.2) with PHP >= 5.1.0
 * roughly 500 MByte of disk space (including images, excluding space for caching (can be disabled)) - this will be less if you use a small block size with your partition
 * about 60 (recommended: 128) MByte of RAM available to PHP (check php.ini)
 * a complete package from the project website ("release") OR a check-out of the svn + the images-package + the arsenaldata.sqlite3 or the SQL-Dump if you want to use MySQL
