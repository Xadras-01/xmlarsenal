With the help of sourcepeek, madx.dk and other sites (including allmighty google) I wrote this little DBC-parser to be able to extract info in an automated process.

The parser is not complete as of yet, it know - for example - only the signed int as a number format which leads to 2 or 3 funny item tooltips. The text recognition could also use an overhaul and the parser uses way to much ram.
