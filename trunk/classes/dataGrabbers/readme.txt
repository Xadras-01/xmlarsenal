
To add support for your favourite Emu just look into Trinity_PVEDataGrabber.php

All the functions that are there (with their respective names) have to be implemented in such a way that they
deliver the same data as output. Nothing else is mandatory to integrate any Emu. You can even use another
DB-Engine (i.e. Oracle or PostgreSQL) if you like.
