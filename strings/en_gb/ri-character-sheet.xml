		<faq question="What is the &quot;Find an Upgrade&quot; option for items in a character profile?">
			Mousing over any item in a character profile displays a small arrow that turns into a button. Clicking this "Find an Upgrade" button will take you to an item search results page. On this page will be a list of items that may be considered upgrades for that item and for that particular character.
			<p/>
			These recommended upgrades take into account the character’s class, statistics, and overall gear quality. In this manner, you can look for upgrades for your character’s items as well as for any other character in World of Warcraft. This feature is also intended to be helpful for characters with multiple gear sets, as they can find upgrades for all their sets.
