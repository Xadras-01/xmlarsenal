		<faq question="Which account should I use to log in to the Armory?">
			World of Warcraft account information should be used to log in to the Armory.
		</faq>	
		<faq question="Why is the Armory asking me to log in with my World of Warcraft account?">
			Certain areas of the Armory require you to log in with your World of Warcraft account to access them because of the nature of the information in these areas. Currently, these areas include the pages devoted to the Guild Bank system and the Player Calendar. Additional login-protected areas may be added in the future.
		</faq>
		<faq question="Are there any other features that are accessible after logging in?">
			The ability to save character profiles for easy reference with our “Pin a Profile” feature has been redesigned. You now can bookmark multiple character profiles of characters on the account you log in with. After logging in, the character profile with the highest relevance as determined by the Armory will automatically appear on the top right of the Armory. Several characters will already be bookmarked via a drop-down menu, and you can see more characters on the account by selecting the appropriate option in that menu.
		</faq>	
		<faq question="I’m concerned about the security of my account information, are you sure this is safe?">
			Make sure that the URL of the Armory page contains wowarmory.com at its root. The login process automatically redirects to our secure login server which is hosted at a Blizzzard Entertainment URL, such as blizzard.com.
		</faq>		
		<faq question="Why am I unable to log in to the Armory?">
			If you are having issues logging in to the Armory, it may be related to your browser's cookie storage. Your browser's settings must allow the Armory to store cookies in order to use the login feature.
		</faq>		
		<faq question="How long does a logged-in session last?">
			You should have access to the login-protected features, including the Guild Bank and Calendar pages, for approximately two weeks after you log in.
		</faq>
		<faq question="Does logging into the Armory log me into the World of Warcraft Account Management site as well?">
			No.
		</faq>
		<faq question="How do I log out?">
			Simply click the "Log Out" option that appears on the top right of the window if you wish to log out of the Armory. Closing your Armory window will no longer log out of the Armory, although deleting your browser's cookies will. In addition, your login session will automatically expire after approximately two weeks.
